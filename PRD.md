### **Product Requirements Document: Todo Frontend Application**

*   **Author:** Cascade & USER
*   **Date:** June 10, 2025
*   **Status:** Inception

#### **1. Introduction & Vision**

This document outlines the requirements for a modern, single-page web application that will serve as the user interface for the existing NestJS Todo backend. The vision is to create a fast, intuitive, and type-safe user experience for managing tasks, built on a robust and scalable monorepo architecture.

#### **2. Goals & Objectives**

*   **Provide a Full-Featured UI:** Create a user interface that supports all existing backend CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for todos.
*   **Establish a Scalable Monorepo:** Implement a clean monorepo structure that separates runnable `apps` from reusable `packages`, enabling seamless code and type sharing.
*   **Ensure End-to-End Type Safety:** Leverage the monorepo to share DTOs between the NestJS backend and the React frontend, eliminating data inconsistencies.
*   **Modern & Performant Stack:** Build with a high-performance, modern technology stack as requested: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, TanStack Query, and Zustand.

#### **3. User Stories**

*   **As a user, I want to see all of my existing todos** so that I can track my current tasks.
*   **As a user, I want to add a new todo** so that I can capture new tasks as they arise.
*   **As a user, I want to mark a todo as complete** so that I can visually track my progress.
*   **As a user, I want to edit the details of a todo** so that I can correct mistakes or add more information.
*   **As a user, I want to delete a todo** so that I can remove completed or irrelevant tasks from my list.

#### **4. Functional Requirements**

| ID  | Feature             | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :-- | :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **FR1** | **View Todos**      | The application shall fetch and display a list of all todos on load. Each todo must show its title, description, and status. The UI must show a loading state while fetching and an error state if the request fails.              |
| **FR2** | **Create a Todo**   | A form shall exist to allow users to input a title and description. Upon submission, the new todo will be sent to the backend and the UI list will update instantly without a page refresh.                                        |
| **FR3** | **Update a Todo**   | Users must be able to change a todo's status (e.g., from 'OPEN' to 'DONE') via a UI control like a checkbox. Users must also be able to edit the title and description of an existing todo.                                          |
| **FR4** | **Delete a Todo**   | Each todo item shall have a control to delete it. To prevent accidental deletion, a confirmation step (e.g., a modal dialog "Are you sure?") should be implemented. The UI must update immediately upon deletion. |

#### **5. Technical Requirements**

*   **Architecture:** Monorepo managed by `pnpm` workspaces, with an `apps` directory for the frontend/backend and a `packages` directory for shared code.
*   **Framework:** React 19 with Vite.
*   **Type Safety & Validation:** Zod for runtime validation of DTOs, complementing TypeScript for static type safety.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS.
*   **Routing:** React Router (`react-router-dom`).
*   **Server State Management:** TanStack Query (formerly React Query) for all API interactions (fetching, creating, updating, deleting).
*   **Global Client State Management:** Zustand for managing simple, non-server UI state if needed (e.g., form inputs, modal visibility).
*   **API Client:** `axios`.

#### **6. Out of Scope (For This Iteration)**

*   User authentication (login/registration).
*   Real-time updates via WebSockets.
*   Advanced searching, filtering, or sorting of todos.
*   Offline functionality.
